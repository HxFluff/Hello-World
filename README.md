# Hello-World

So Hello github world, My name is Paul and I am just getting into Coding. I am hear because I want to learn and I am supporter of open source and code sharing. 

I will be hoping to post up my work as I learn and create programs. I imagine they are not going to be of great use to anyone but just will show my journey in learning how to code in various languages. 

Thanks for reading. 
Paul.
